In a multithreading enviornment, threads often need to communicate and coordinate with each other to accomplish a task.



üîÑ What is Thread Communication?
Thread communication means threads working together and sharing data, without causing conflicts.

In Java, multiple threads can run in parallel, but sometimes:

1. One thread must wait for another to finish a task.
2. Threads need to share a resource (e.g., a counter, object, file).
3. Threads must coordinate their actions to avoid errors like race conditions.
‚û°Ô∏è So, thread communication is how we coordinate multiple threads safely.

üìö Example Scenario:

Imagine this simple case:

1.One thread produces data (Producer).
2.Another thread consumes that data (Consumer).

Both must coordinate:

1. Producer should not produce if buffer is full.
2. Consumer should not consume if buffer is empty.
That‚Äôs thread communication in action.

üõ†Ô∏è How Thread Communication Works in Java
Java provides three core methods for communication:

1.wait()
2.notify()
3.notifyAll()
These are used inside synchronized blocks or methods only.
