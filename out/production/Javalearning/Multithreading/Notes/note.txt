A thread is a lightweight sub-process, a smallest unit of processing.





Thread LifeCycle
NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → BLOCKED/WAITING → TERMINATED

NEW: Thread created but not started.
RUNNABLE: Ready to run, waiting for CPU.
RUNNING: Currently executing.
BLOCKED/WAITING: Waiting for some resource or signal.
TERMINATED: Execution finished.






Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads (smaller units of a process) run concurrently to perform different tasks at the same time.

🔍 In simple words:
Imagine your computer is cooking, washing dishes, and vacuuming — all at the same time. Each task is a thread, and all threads belong to one main program (process).



💡 Why use multithreading?
To make programs faster and more efficient.
To perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
To improve performance, especially on multi-core processors.



📌 Real-life examples:
A web browser: One thread loads the page, another plays music, another handles user input.



A game: One thread handles graphics, one for user input, one for sound, etc.


🧠 In Java:
Java has built-in support for multithreading using the Thread class or implementing Runnable interface.




Example:

class MyThread extends Thread {|
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("This thread is running...");
    }
}


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // Starts a new thread
        System.out.println("Main thread is running...");
    }
}




📝 Key terms:
Thread: Smallest unit of execution.
Process: A running program (can have multiple threads).
Concurrency: Multiple tasks progress at the same time.
Parallelism: Tasks actually run at the same time (true multitasking).



when java program Starts, one thread begin running imediately, which is called the main thread.This thread is responsible for executing the main method of a program.




Thread Methods..............................................
Method	Description
start()	Starts the thread (calls run() internally)
run()	Entry point of thread code
sleep(ms)	Pause thread for milliseconds
join()	Wait for another thread to finish
yield()	Pause current thread and give chance to others
isAlive()	Check if thread is alive

✅ Why Use Threads in Java?
Threads allow concurrent execution of tasks, which means multiple parts of your program can run at the same time, rather than one after another (sequentially).

This is especially useful for:

Better performance
Responsive applications
Efficient use of CPU resources
💡 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine you're in a kitchen:

Single-threaded: One person does all tasks: chopping, boiling, frying — one after another.
Multithreaded: One person boils water while another chops vegetables — tasks run in parallel. Cooking is faster and smoother!

⚡ Real Benefits of Using Threads:
Benefit	Explanation
Concurrency	Run multiple tasks at once (e.g., downloading a file while user scrolls a page)
Responsiveness	UI remains active even during heavy tasks
Faster Execution	Utilize multiple CPU cores efficiently
Background Tasks	Execute tasks like logging, file saving, notifications in background
Real-Time Applications	Used in games, chat apps, real-time data processing
Server Programming	Handle thousands of users at the same time (each request = a thread)

🔍 Example Use Cases of Threads in Java:
Web Servers / APIs
Each user request is handled by a separate thread.

Desktop Applications (Swing/JavaFX)
UI thread + worker threads for tasks like file reading or processing.

Gaming Engines
Separate threads for rendering graphics, handling input, physics, sound, etc.

Chat/Messaging Apps
One thread for listening to incoming messages, one for sending, etc.

File Downloaders
Multithreaded downloading (download parts of a file in parallel).

Background Job Schedulers
Automated tasks running on schedule (reminders, email sending, etc.).

📊 Without Threads vs With Threads
Without Threads (Single-threaded):

doTask1();  // long
doTask2();  // starts only after task1 finishes
With Threads (Multithreaded):

new Thread(() -> doTask1()).start();
new Thread(() -> doTask2()).start();
Both tasks run simultaneously, reducing total time and improving performance.

🚀 Modern Usage
Java has improved thread handling using:


Executors (Thread Pools)
Callable, Future, CompletableFuture
ForkJoinPool
Virtual Threads (introduced in newer Java versions - lightweight threads)


🎯 Summary:
Reason to Use Threads	Outcome
Faster processing	Tasks don’t block each other
Keep UI smooth	No freezing
Better CPU usage	Multiple cores = full power
Real-time multitasking	Parallel activities
