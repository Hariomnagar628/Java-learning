What is Executor Framework?

The Executor Framework in Java is part of java.util.concurrent package. It provides a high-level API for managing threads and tasks, making it easier to manage multithreading compared to using Thread or Runnable directly.

âœ… Why use Executor Framework?

1.Easier thread management
2.Reuse of threads from a thread pool (no need to create a new thread every time)
3.Better control over task execution
4.Can manage multiple tasks efficiently

ðŸ“¤ Methods in ExecutorService:
1.submit() â€“ to submit tasks
2.shutdown() â€“ stops accepting new tasks
3.shutdownNow() â€“ forcibly stops all tasks
4.awaitTermination() â€“ wait for all tasks to finish
5.invokeAll() / invokeAny() â€“ execute multiple tasks

âœ… Why We Use Executor Framework in Java:

1. Better Thread Management

   You donâ€™t need to manually create or manage Thread objects.
   Threads are reused from a pool, which improves performance and saves memory.

2. Improves Performance

   Creating new threads for every task is expensive. Executor reuses existing threads.
   Thread Pooling reduces overhead.

3.Scalability
 
 It handles multiple tasks concurrently.
 You can control the maximum number of threads, preventing resource overuse.

4.Simpler Code
  
  Instead of writing boilerplate thread creation code, you just call submit() or execute().
 
5. Graceful Shutdown
  
   You can properly stop task execution using shutdown() or shutdownNow() methods.

6. Task Scheduling
  
   With ScheduledExecutorService, you can run tasks after a delay or at fixed intervals (like cron jobs).

7. Advanced Features
  
   You can submit Callable tasks, get results via Future, cancel tasks, or handle exceptions properly.
